Wet rains the tear into my eyes
When I began to realize
I cried so much since you been gone
I guess I'll drown in my own tears

I've really cried just like a child
My poor little tears are running wild
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown, oh-yeah, in my own tears

I know it's true, into each life
Well, some rain, rain must fall
Clouds over here without you

It keeps a-rainin' more and more
Why can't you come on home
Oh-yes, so I won't be all alone

If you don't think, you'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh don't let me drown in my own tears
